This folder contains the files that can be uploaded using the Import function of a Mastodon instance.
To import, use Preferences -> Import and export -> Import, Select option "Domain Blocking list" and select the CSV file to be imported.
If you're unsure whether to merge or overwrite, export your current blocking list (for backup) and proceed with merging.
