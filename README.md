# blocklists
Blocklists for ActivityPub-based sites, but mostly for Mastodon.

These blocklists are based on
* Seirdy's FediNuke.txt and pleroma.envs.net blocklists
* Oliphant's 100 percent, Gardenfence blocklists.
* Seirdy's Birdsite mirror blocklist
* Some of my own additions.
You can select which one you'd prefer, by downloading the selected file.
